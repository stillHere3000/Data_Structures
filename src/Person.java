/*
 * The Person Class. 
 *      Create a public class named Person that contains two private data variables 
 *      called id (of type int) and name (of type String). 
 *      Create a constructor for the person class that receives two parameters, id (type int) and name (type String). 
 *      In your constructor, assign the values to the appropriate class variables. 
 *      Add the id() and name() methods to the class to return the value of the appropriate variables. 
 *      Also add a setName() method to set the name variable. Note that the id variable must not be able to be changed. 
 *      (What modifier is used to make that happen?). Override Objectâ€™s equals method. 
 *      Two Person objects are considered equal if: 
 *          (a)they are both Person objects (or subclasses of Person - Java has a keyword to check this for you), 
 *          (b) their ID numbers match, and 
 *          (c) their names match exactly. All three conditions must be met: 
 *          if any one of them fails, the objects are not equal. 
 *      Finally, add a method such that when a person object is printed 
 *      (with System.out.println) it will display something like Person[id=1234, name=John Smythe].
